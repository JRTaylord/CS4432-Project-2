Task 3

    

Task 4

    The prerequisite amount of shotgun surgery required to complete this task
    made it nigh impossible to fully implement. What was able to be accomplished
    was the implementation of the sorted tags on the tables and the logic within
    SmartSortPlan where it checks if the relevant table's info shows if it's
    sorted and returns a basic table scan. Additionally both the SmartMerge
    classes are empty aside from extending their base classes.

Task 5

    The ExploitSortQueryPlanner SmartMergeJoins each data source it is given
    and should output the desired result. Unfortunately due to the backend side
    of task 4 being too complicated to complete, testing was not feasible.
    Although it should be theoretically faster if SmartMergeJoin is used instead
    of MergeJoin due to the program having the tables and views presorted.
